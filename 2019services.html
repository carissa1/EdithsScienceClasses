                    Course description: This course will be held for 2 hours per week for 32 weeks. 
                    This course will emphasize the development of student's scientific process skills, 
                    laboratory techniques and an understanding of the fundamental principles of living organisms. 
                    Topics include cell structure and function, genetics and heredity, diversity of living organisms 
                    and their ecological roles, and an introduction to animal structure and function. 
                    As scientific learners, students will collect and analyze data, interpret results, 
                    draw conclusions and communicate their findings. Dissections will be part of some of our labs.
