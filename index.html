            <b>I have loved sharing my passion for science for nearly ten years with my students. 
            However, I have decided not to teach next year since my homeschooled children will be 
            entering their high school journey. Once my family is set with their school plans, 
            I plan to return to teach in the 2024-2025 school year. 
            By then, I will be able to give my time and attention to my students fully. <br><br>
            Thank you all for your support. 
            Teaching all these years has been a rewarding and amazing experience. 
            I have seen exceptional young students grow and leave for college through all 
            these years. Thank you for letting me be a small part of their education. <br><br>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Weekly Zoom meetings:</b> Every class consists of a lecture followed by experiments to collect data. Students will perform weekly live labs along with the teacher and classmates. Students will analyze data, interpret results, draw conclusions, and communicate their findings in the breakout rooms. Notes and labs are sent weekly to print out. 
            Students receive a google link and a ThinkWave account. In this account, students will be able to follow PowerPoint slides for each lesson, see weekly schedules, upload their homework assignments, review their vocabulary, watch videos related to the lesson, and check their grades. ThinkWave documents and grades will be updated weekly.
            A list of lab materials will be sent to purchase for students to do the experiments at home with the teacher's guidance. Most of the devices/materials needed to conduct the lab activities can be found in a typical household.

        <br>
        <p>
            I earned a Nuclear and Chemical Engineering degree from 
            the University of California, Berkeley.  Some of my strengths 
            are in Thermal Engineering, Reactor Design, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics.  
            I have worked doing research at the National Institute of Health and Argonne National Lab.  
            I have worked in the past organizing many tutoring programs for UC Berkeley and coordinating a medicine-oriented summer program for high school students (FACES for the Future in Oakland)  This is my 5th year teaching science from Elementary to High School students.

        <br>
        <p>
            Homeschooling has been a wonderful experience for my family.   My husband and I enjoy sharing our passion for science to our kids.  
            Whenever they are interested in learning something new, we learn it together. 
            Now I am sharing my passion for science with other families.  I want my students to love science as much as I do.  Through hands-on labs (K-12th) and open class discussions, 
            my students learn to think critically. They develop problem-solving skills by asking questions and analyzing evidence without feeling intimidated about the challenges of science.  
            We learn science through our senses!

                My name is Jasmine Amaya.  I will be transferring into a BioEngineering program next year. I have completed all the upper math courses at Diablo Valley College, and this semester, I am completing the Physics for engineers requirements to transfer. I am currently a chemistry tutor at DVC and a math and science tutor for middle and high school students.
                I have experience working with children. I worked at ARF as a Teen Counselor, and at the Oakland Zoo as a Teen Wild Guide. I was not only a student at Mrs. Penn's class, but I also volunteered to assist with the labs. I am thrilled to join Mrs. Penn on her mission to share her love for STEM subjects.
                I look forward to teaching your children to find passion in science and math through hands-on experiences!
